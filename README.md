# Ruby Statistics
![](https://github.com/estebanz01/ruby-statistics/actions/workflows/ruby.yml/badge.svg)

## Note regarding Versions 3.x and 4.x
Hola! :wave: right now the gem got an update that introduced a breaking change in master where the Outermost namespace was changed to be `ruby-statistics` instead of `statistics`. This change is in _master_ already and released in version 4.0. If you're relying on branch instead of gem version, you can checkout branch `3.x`. This branch will be supported but no additional features will be added.

## Note regarding Big Decimal support
This gem also provides basic support for `BigDecimal` and the gem is listed as an optional `development` dependency on the gemspec. Since it's no longer supported as a bundled feature since 3.4.0, the functionality around this gem is going to be limited as well. It is not a required dependency to run or use any of the features developed so far. :grin:

---

A basic ruby gem that implements some statistical methods, functions and concepts to be used in any ruby environment without depending on any mathematical software like `R`, `Matlab`, `Octave` or similar.

Unit test runs under the following ruby versions:
* Ruby 3.2.
* Ruby 3.3.
* Ruby 3.4.
* Ruby 4.0.

We got the inspiration from the folks at [JStat](https://github.com/jstat/jstat) and some interesting lectures about [Keystroke dynamics](http://www.biometric-solutions.com/keystroke-dynamics.html).

Some logic and algorithms are extractions or adaptations from other authors, which are referenced in the comments.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ruby-statistics'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ruby-statistics

## Basic Usage

just require the `ruby-statistics` gem in order to load it. If you don't have defined the `Distribution` namespace, the gem will assign an alias, reducing the number of namespaces needed to use a class.

Right now you can load:

* The whole statistics gem. `require 'ruby-statistics'`
* A namespace. `require 'ruby-statistics/distribution'`
* A class. `require 'ruby-statistics/distribution/normal'`

Feel free to use the one that is more convenient to you.

### Hello-World Example
```ruby
require 'ruby-statistics'

poisson = Distribution::Poisson.new(l) # Using Distribution alias.
normal = RubyStatistics::Distribution::StandardNormal.new # Using all namespaces.
```

### Wilcoxon signed-rank test (paired samples)

`RubyStatistics::StatisticalTest::WilcoxonSignedRankTest` tests paired
differences `x_i - y_i` measured on the same subjects (or a single sample of
differences), unlike `WilcoxonRankSumTest`, which compares two independent
groups.

```ruby
test = RubyStatistics::StatisticalTest::WilcoxonSignedRankTest.new
test.perform(0.05, :two_tail, before, after, zero_method: :pratt)
```

* `zero_method: :wilcoxon` discards zero differences before ranking;
  `zero_method: :pratt` keeps them in the ranking (they occupy the lowest rank
  positions) but they contribute nothing to the statistic. The same convention
  is applied to the test, the Hodges-Lehmann estimate and the acceptance set.
* Tied absolute differences get midranks; the exact null distribution is built
  by dynamic programming over the actual (possibly tied) ranks, scaled by 2 so
  half-integer ranks become integers. A no-ties table is never used when ties
  are present. One-sided and two-sided exact p-values are reported; a
  tie-corrected normal approximation is available via `method: :normal`.
* The result includes the Hodges-Lehmann estimate (median of the Walsh
  averages) and the acceptance set obtained by inverting the same test.
  `acceptance_set` is the exact set of accepted location shifts (a list of
  components); `confidence_interval` is only its interval envelope: when
  `acceptance_gaps` is true the envelope contains small rejected gaps, so it
  is conservative (true coverage is at least the nominal confidence level).

## Documentation
You can find a bit more detailed documentation of all available distributions, tests and functions in the [Documentation Index](https://github.com/estebanz01/ruby-statistics/wiki)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
