# Ruby Statistics
![](https://github.com/estebanz01/ruby-statistics/actions/workflows/ruby.yml/badge.svg)

## Note regarding Versions 3.x and 4.x
Hola! :wave: right now the gem got an update that introduced a breaking change in master where the Outermost namespace was changed to be `ruby-statistics` instead of `statistics`. This change is in _master_ already and released in version 4.0. If you're relying on branch instead of gem version, you can checkout branch `3.x`. This branch will be supported but no additional features will be added.

## Note regarding Big Decimal support
This gem also provides basic support for `BigDecimal` and the gem is listed as an optional `development` dependency on the gemspec. Since it's no longer supported as a bundled feature since 3.4.0, the functionality around this gem is going to be limited as well. It is not a required dependency to run or use any of the features developed so far. :grin:

---

A basic ruby gem that implements some statistical methods, functions and concepts to be used in any ruby environment without depending on any mathematical software like `R`, `Matlab`, `Octave` or similar.

Unit test runs under the following ruby versions:
* Ruby 3.2.
* Ruby 3.3.
* Ruby 3.4.
* Ruby 4.0.

We got the inspiration from the folks at [JStat](https://github.com/jstat/jstat) and some interesting lectures about [Keystroke dynamics](http://www.biometric-solutions.com/keystroke-dynamics.html).

Some logic and algorithms are extractions or adaptations from other authors, which are referenced in the comments.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ruby-statistics'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ruby-statistics

## Basic Usage

just require the `ruby-statistics` gem in order to load it. If you don't have defined the `Distribution` namespace, the gem will assign an alias, reducing the number of namespaces needed to use a class.

Right now you can load:

* The whole statistics gem. `require 'ruby-statistics'`
* A namespace. `require 'ruby-statistics/distribution'`
* A class. `require 'ruby-statistics/distribution/normal'`

Feel free to use the one that is more convenient to you.

### Hello-World Example
```ruby
require 'ruby-statistics'

poisson = Distribution::Poisson.new(l) # Using Distribution alias.
normal = RubyStatistics::Distribution::StandardNormal.new # Using all namespaces.
```

### Robust location and scatter

`RubyStatistics::MinimumCovarianceDeterminant` implements the Minimum Covariance Determinant estimator for numeric vectors.

```ruby
data = [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1], [10, 10]]
result = RubyStatistics::MinimumCovarianceDeterminant.fit(data, h: 4, reweight: true)

result.support                         # [0, 1, 2, 3]
result.center                          # [0.5, 0.5]
result.scatter                         # p x p MLE scatter of the h-subset
result.generalized_determinant         # objective in the observed affine span
result.reweighted_weights              # [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]
result.verified_global_optimum?        # exact enumeration
```

Small problems enumerate every h-subset when `C(n, h) <= max_combinations` (10,000 by default). Larger problems use deterministic initial starts plus a fixed-seed set of randomized starts followed by C-steps. Passing `exact: false` forces search mode and leaves `status` as `:search_candidate`; exact enumeration returns `:verified_global_optimum`.

Low-rank data and duplicate observations are reported as singular fits with warnings instead of being perturbed by noise. An `h` smaller than the observed affine rank plus one raises `ArgumentError`. Reweighting is opt-in: call `.fit(..., reweight: true)` or call `#reweight(cutoff: 0.975)` on a raw result.

## Documentation
You can find a bit more detailed documentation of all available distributions, tests and functions in the [Documentation Index](https://github.com/estebanz01/ruby-statistics/wiki)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
